## Simple web app to check what games are/aren't working on the Ryujinx emulator.

I did this project in a couple of hours because I was bored, and the current way of checking which games work and which don't in Ryujinx seems like a pain in the ass to me, so don't pay too much attention to the chaotic and uncommented code. Original names for the project are welcome!
