## Simple web app to check what games are/aren't working on the Ryujinx emulator.

I did this project in a couple of hours because I was bored, and the current way of checking which games work and which don't in Ryujinx seems to me a pain in the ass.

## Build
`npm run build`

## Develop
`npm run dev`
